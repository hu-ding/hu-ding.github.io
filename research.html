                            <p style="color:#000000">In general, I am interested in designing efficient and provable
                                algorithms for solving real world problems. My primary research area is computational
                                geometry, in particular on geometric optimization algorithms in high dimensions. We can
                                often see trends or clusters in data by graphing or plotting-- giving geometric form to
                                data. As data increases in volume and complexity, giving it geometric form and then
                                developing computational geometry algorithms is still a fruitful way to approach data
                                analysis. For example, activity data from a smartphone or fitness tracker can be viewed
                                as a point in thousands of dimensions whose coordinates include all positions, heart
                                rates, etc. from an entire sequence of measurements.  For better privacy, we can share
                                summaries (rough position, duration, etc.) as points in tens of dimensions.  Points from
                                many people can be clustered to identify similar patterns, and patterns matched (with
                                unreliable data identified and discarded) to recognize actions that a digital assistant
                                could take to improve quality of life or health outcomes. Below, we briefly show some
                                examples and the results obtained from our research. </p>

                            <h3>Example 1: Clustering</h3>
                            <div class="margin-b-30"></div>
                            <p style="color:#000000">Clustering is one of the most fundamental problems in computer
                                science, and finds numerous applications in many different areas, such as data
                                management, machine learning, bioinformatics, networking. The common goal of many
                                clustering problems is to partition a set of given data items into a number of clusters
                                so as to minimize the total cost measured by a certain objective function. For example,
                                the popular k-means clustering seeks k mean points to induce a partition of the given
                                data items so that the average squared distance from each data item to its closest mean
                                point is minimized. However, in many real-world applications, data items are often
                                constrained or correlated, which require a great deal of effort to handle such
                                additional constraints. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to various
                                types of constrained clustering problems, such as l-diversity clustering, r-gather
                                clustering, capacitated clustering, fair clustering. One key property exhibited in many
                                unconstrained clustering problems is the so called locality property, which indicates
                                that each cluster is located entirely inside the Voronoi cell of its center. Existing
                                algorithms for these clustering problems often rely on such a property. However, due to
                                the additional constraints, the locality property may no longer exist. We present a
                                unified framework called Peeling-and-Enclosing (PnE), based on two standalone geometric
                                techniques called Simplex Lemma and Weaker Simplex Lemma, to solve a class of
                                constrained clustering problems without the locality property in Euclidean space, where
                                the dimensionality of the space could be rather high.</p>

                            <h3>Example 2: Geometric Matching and Alignment</h3>
                            <div class="margin-b-30"></div>
                            <p style="color:#000000">Given two patterns in Euclidean space, where each pattern is
                                represented by a (weighted) point set, the goal of geometric matching is to compute the
                                mapping between them with the smallest matching cost (e.g., Hausdorff distance or Earth
                                Mover’s Distance). If the point sets are not fixed the space, the problem is called
                                "geometric alignment" which aims to find appropriate transformations (e.g., rigid or
                                affine transformation) and minimize the matching cost simultaneously. Geometric matching
                                and alignment are fundamental optimization problems, and find many applications in real
                                world, such as face recognition, fingerprint alignment. Moreover, as the recent
                                developments of representation learning theory, a number of machine learning problems
                                can be embedded into Euclidean spaces and reduced to geometric alignment, such as
                                network alignment and unsupervised bilingual learning. We provide a Fully Polynomial
                                Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for solving the geometric alignment problem under
                                rigid transformation.</p>
                            <p style="color:#000000">We also study a new geometric optimization problem called the
                                "geometric prototype'' in Euclidean space. Given a set of point sets, the geometric
                                prototype can be viewed as the "average pattern'' minimizing the total matching cost to
                                them. As a general model, the problem finds many applications in real-world, such as
                                Wasserstein barycenter and ensemble clustering. To our best knowledge, the general
                                geometric prototype problem has yet to be seriously considered by the theory community.
                                To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we show that a small core-set can be
                                obtained to substantially reduce the data size. Consequently, any existing heuristic or
                                algorithm can run on the core-set to achieve a great improvement on the efficiency.</p>

                            <h3>Example 3: Outlier Removal and Robust Optimization</h3>
                            <div class="margin-b-30"></div>
                            <p style="color:#000000">In this big data era, we are confronted with an extremely large
                                amount of data and it is important to develop efficient algorithmic techniques to handle
                                the arising realistic issues. Due to its recent rapid development, machine learning
                                becomes a powerful tool for many emerging applications; meanwhile, the quality of
                                training dataset often plays a key role and seriously affects the final learning result.
                                For example, we can collect tremendous data (e.g., texts or images) through the
                                internet, however, the obtained dataset often contains a significant amount of outliers.
                                Since manually removing outliers will be very costly, it is very necessary to develop
                                some efficient algorithms for recognizing outliers automatically in many scenarios.
                                Outlier recognition is a typical unsupervised learning problem and the given data are
                                unlabeled; thus we can only model it as an optimization problem based on some reasonable
                                assumption in practice. For instance, it is very natural to assume that the inliers
                                (i.e., normal data) locate in some dense region while the outliers are scattered in the
                                feature space. We study several fundamental optimization problems with outliers, such as
                                clustering, classification, and linear regression, and design provable algorithms for
                                them.</p>

                            <p style="color:#000000">Truth Discovery is an important problem arising in data analytics
                                related fields such as data mining, database, and big data. It concerns about finding
                                the most trustworthy information from a dataset acquired from a number of unreliable
                                sources. Due to its importance, the problem has been extensively studied in recent years
                                and a number techniques have already been proposed. However, all of them are of
                                heuristic nature and do not have any quality guarantee. We formulate the problem as a
                                high dimensional geometric optimization problem, called Entropy based Geometric
                                Variance. Relying on a number of novel geometric techniques (such as Log-Partition and
                                Modified Simplex Lemma), we further discover new insights to this problem. We show, for
                                the first time, that the truth discovery problem can be solved with guaranteed quality
                                of solution. Particularly, we show that it is possible to achieve a
                                (1+eps)-approximation within nearly linear time under some reasonable assumptions. We
                                expect that our algorithm will be useful for other data related applications.</p>

                                territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental
                                genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X
                                chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The
                                usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled
                                researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial
                                resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and
                                automated image analysis methods. We introduce a novel algorithmic tool for
                                investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells.
                                Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information
                                about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that
                                contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural
                                representative. We formulate this combinatorial problem as a semi-definite programming
                                and present novel geometric techniques to efficiently solve it.</p>
